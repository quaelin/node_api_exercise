# Node.js API Exercise

This repo provides a basic framework for a Node.js restful API for our live
coding exercise. Be sure to have this code checked out locally and have
Node/npm set up prior to the interview.

## Overview

The app was built using Node.js 18. To get it running, do:

```sh
$ npm ci
$ npm run db:create
$ npm run db:create:tests
$ npm run db:populate
$ npm start
```

The app will then be available at http://127.0.0.1:3000/

There are also unit tests that you can run with

```sh
$ npm test
```
